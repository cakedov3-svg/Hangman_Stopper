# Hangman_Stopper
Hardware and peripheral control project for the MSP-EXP430FR6989 LaunchPad using Code Composer Studio.

Project done in Computer Architecture during my third year at university. 
The main concept of the project was to develop some kind of program where we proved our knowledge over the C implementation and use of peripherals alongside my partner Cameron Sanchez.
I decided, along with my partner Cameron Sanchez, to create a mix of two games: Hangman and a countdown timer. You chose one of them using the two buttons under the LCD display: one was a classic hangman game where you 
introduced the letters using the keyboard, while the other one was a competitive two-player game where a timer was shown going up and disappeared at some point, and you had to keep the mental count 
to stop it at a certain point. Both players took turns and got points related to how close they were.
